## About me

I like caring for quality and I appreciate contact with people. Analysing and solving clients' 
problems make me satisfied. For a long time, however, I have been thinking over a change of my 
professional profile to fulfil my potential. Recently I got into IT and programming languages. 
Because of the tough pandemic time, I decided to change my professional profile dramatically, 
so I started to learn it on my own and do some testing tasks under the tutelage of my 
acquaintances, who have a great deal of experience in IT. I have learnt the basics of SQL, JSON, 
XML, XPath, I have also familiarised myself with apps such as IntelliJ IDEA (generating test data 
in Java), SoapUI or Postman, Selenium IDE environment, and learnt how to use regex to prepare 
testing data. I started preparing for the ISTQB FL certificate also. I know how to use technical 
documentation, either in English or Polish, and care for its quality. I am looking for a job in 
which I would be able to make use of my skills and develop them
